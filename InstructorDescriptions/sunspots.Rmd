### Description

Sunspots are dark areas on the surface of the sun. They look dark because they are cooler than other parts of the sunâ€™s surface. They form at where magnetic fields are particularly strong---strong enough to keep some of the heat inside the sun from reaching the surface. Reasonably reliable records of sunspot counts go back to the early 1700s.

### Variables

* `year`: calendar year
* `month`: calendar month (1-12)
* `date`: decimal date combining year and month
* `average`: average number of sunspots per day
* `sd`: standard deviation of number of sunspots
