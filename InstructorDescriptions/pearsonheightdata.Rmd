### Description

Karl Pearson studied the relationship between the heights of men and their adult sons, similar to research done by his colleague [Francis Galton](galtonheightdata.html). Pearsonâ€™s original data was measured and rounded to the nearest inch. The authors of an introductory statistics tectbook added a small amount of random uniform noise "to render it continuous"---but not large enough to fundamentally change its meaning. 


### Variables

* father: father's height in inches
* son: son's height in inches

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
DATA <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/pearsonheightdata.csv")
