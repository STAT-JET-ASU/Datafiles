### Description

Anthropometry is the measurement and study of the physical proportions and functional capabilities of the human body. The name is derived from the Greek word *anthros* ("man") and *metron* ("measure"). The contemporary field of ergonomics (also known as *human factors*) explicitly considers anthropometric principles in the design of many products, processes, and systems intended for use by people (e.g., clothing, furniture, medical devices, hand tools, keyboards, vehicles). There are many important applications in the area of [safety](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/anthropometry/default.html), including construction of vehicle [crash test dummies](http://www.humaneticsatd.com/crash-test-dummies/). Crime scene investigators, pathologists, historians, and forensic anthropologists also make extensive use of anthropometric measurements. The related term *craniometry* refers to measurements of the cranium (skull).
