### Description

A student preparing for a triathlon suspected that the time she spent training in the pool was damaging her nail polish. She wished to investigate whether the color of the nail polish might make a difference. To investigate this, she mounted acrylic nails on sticks and polished them with two different color nail polishes. She soaked them together in a chlorine solution equivalent to a swimming poolâ€™s chlorination and then tapped them 100 times on a computer keyboard to simulate daily stress. The response is the % of nail chipped off as measured by scanning images of the nails and using an image processing program.

### Variables

* Color: nail polish color
* PctChipped: % of nail chipped off during stress testing
